# Parallelizing Data Processing with Spark on Google Cloud

This repository contains the work focusing on parallelization, cloud performance evaluation, and using Spark and TensorFlow/Keras for data processing and machine learning.

This is the Big Data coursework from my MSc in Data Science at City, University of London, where I achieved **distinction**.

## Sections:

### 1. Preprocessing and Parallelization with Spark
- **Task**: Preprocess image data (Flowers dataset) using TensorFlow and parallelize the process with Apache Spark on Google Cloud.
- **Code**: The preprocessing code was adapted for Spark and executed on the cloud using Google Cloud Dataproc.
- **Tools Used**: Apache Spark, Google Cloud Dataproc, Python
- **Outcome**: Parallelized preprocessing to improve processing speed and scalability.

### 2. Measuring Cloud Performance
- **Task**: Parallelize the measurement of reading speeds in cloud configurations using Spark.
- **Code**: Performance measuring code executed in cloud environments, utilizing Spark for parallel processing.
- **Tools Used**: Apache Spark, Google Cloud Dataproc
- **Outcome**: Performance metrics collected for various cloud configurations.

### 3. Theoretical Discussion
- **Task**: A theoretical analysis based on a paper, discussed in the report.
- **Outcome**: Analytical answers provided as a part of the coursework submission.

## Notes:
This coursework involves practical applications of Spark and cloud computing. While parts of the project are based on lessons from the [Fast and Lean Data Science](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/tree/master/courses/fast-and-lean-data-science) course by Martin Gorner, the implementations and outcomes are my own contributions.
